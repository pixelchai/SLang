# SLang
I basically made this language so that I can make, e.g, modular programs which can have their functionalities extended with simple scripts. I also wanted to make the interpretation of the language relatively simple to implement.

Usage cases include: config files, extending functionality to a modular programs, etc

I initially conceptualised this language during my other project, Serien, for which I also made a working slang interpreter [here](https://github.com/starryyy/Serien/tree/master/libslang). I am now devoloping the language further.
